# Tumour-Detection
This project applies machine learning for tumor detection, classifying tumors as benign or malignant. After preprocessing and feature scaling, a Random Forest Classifier achieved ~95â€“98% accuracy. The model shows strong potential as a decision-support tool for early medical diagnosis.
